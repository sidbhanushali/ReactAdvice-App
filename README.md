# React.js Advice App 

  

üöÄüí™üèΩThis project is deployed at: [https://sids-advice-app.netlify.app](https://sids-advice-app.netlify.app/)

A simple responsive web-app built in react.js that fetches the best advice ever. Data used in this app is courtesy  from Advice Slip API: [https://api.adviceslip.com/](https://api.adviceslip.com/) *

**The api endpoint only updates about once every 5 seconds or so, so spamming clicks will not render new advice until the endpoint is done updating.*

  

## Project purpose and scope

- Deploy and polish an old project sitting in local archives 

- Use create-react-app to bootstrap react boilerplate

- use Fetch API to get data from API 

- Learn and Impliment React Lifecylce methods, state, and class-based components

- Improve on and practice CSS princlplals


## **Packages and technologies used**

- **HTML/CSS/JS**:  edit app and create structure 

- **React.js**: front-end javascript framework 

- **Fetch-API:** built in network request API in javascript that returns promises

- **Netlify:** deployment cli and site hosting

  

## App demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
